# Verbals

Any *verbal* entity may consist of one string parameter, "name", possibly zero-length, and one ordered set, "values", possibly empty,
consisting of strings. An "ownerId" string is required. None of the parameters need be unique.

The service purpose is prototyping a microservices delivery model. The purpose will be fully met if similar services can be 
outsourced through dependence on the service contract standard developed for Verbals.
